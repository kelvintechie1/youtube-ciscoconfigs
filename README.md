# YouTube - Cisco Configurations (Kelvin Tran)
A repository containing the Cisco device configurations from my videos. 

Files may be stored in the following formats:
.ios files - plain text files containing individual device configurations
.yaml - Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) lab exports, human-readable, contains configs for all devices

The configurations will be organized by month and by particular video. Please note that this is being provided with no obligation of any sort from me at all and is provided on a purely as-is basis.
